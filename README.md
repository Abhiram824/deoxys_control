# Deoxys

A light-weight real-time control framework for robot learning research. This has been developed internally in Robot Perception and Learning Lab from the University of Texas at Austin.

## Project Gallery
Deoxys has supported lots of past research in RPL.


## Feature
1. A lightweight codebase with a versatile set of robot controllers, including operational space controller (cartesian impedance), joint impedance controller.
2. Easy-to-use functional APIs to mimic the process of imitation learning in robosuite.
3. Beginner friendly implementation for better code understanding.
